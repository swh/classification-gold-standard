Qubit Generation for Quantum Computing refers to patents that discuss the
various means of generating qubits for use in a quantum mechanics based
computing system. Types of qubits included superconducting loops, topological,
quantum dot based and ion-trap methods as well as others. The excluded
technologies are applications, algorithms and other auxiliary aspects of
quantum computing that do not mention a hardware component, and hardware for
other quantum phenomena outside of qubit generation.
